       It  is  my  great  pleasure  to welcome  you  to  the Christian  university  college this Day. I wish to congratulate each of you, first on having secured your place at
       Christian university college and second, for having the good sense to choose to study at the Christian university college. 
        At  C.U.C,  we  put  the center  of  everything  he  /  she  does;  your  experience here  at  C.U.C.  And your success is important to each member of the staff who works here. <br> Your arrival at the  Christian  university  college  makes  a  new chapter  in  the  story  of  your  life. However, this chapter is a bit different.  The preceding chapters were largely written by others â€“your parents, guardians, families, teachers, and the like. Now you will be the principal author of the next chapter, you have the opportunity to determine the direction, the plot and tempo of your story.   This can seem as daunting as it is exciting as challenging, as it is empowering. However, the great thing is that you are doing something that you have chosen to do, not something, that was chosen for you by others.
       Moreover, while you are here at Christian University College, you will have the opportunity to learn new things acquire new knowledge, develop new skills, and
       enhance  your  personal  attributes  in  profound  ways  that  will  equip  you  for  life after university. At the same time, you will make new friends who will become your friend <br> for life, with whom you will share memories of your university days with for many years to come. The week and for next few weeks you are likely to be bombarded with information and I am conscious of the danger of adding to information overload. Nevertheless, I wish to shard three pieces of advice
         With you.
       1.  Take responsibility for your learning.
       2.  Make the most of your time at Christian University College
       3.  Embrace the difference
       The university is a melting pot. You have come from different backgrounds and communities  to  pursue  your  ambitions  as  students,  so  knowing  other  and understanding others will <br> help you develop as tolerant individuals. In addition, with  those  few  words  of  advice,  I  wish  all  of  you  success  at  the  Christian University  College  and  I am  confident  that  you  will  find  it  a immensely rewarding experience.
